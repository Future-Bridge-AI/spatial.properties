Pricing FAQ microcopy (high-signal)

What counts as “a pack”?
A pack is a versioned release: assets + manifest. You can publish as many versions as you need.

Do we pay per user?
Typically no. Pricing aligns to storage, delivery, and governance features, not seat count.

Can we keep data in our own cloud?
Yes—deployment models can support customer-managed storage with platform-managed manifests and delivery controls (depending on plan).

How do you handle restricted licensing?
License and provenance checks are enforced at publish time and again at access time. If it doesn’t comply, it doesn’t ship.

Pricing disclaimer (short, credible)

Final pricing depends on storage tier, delivery volume, tenancy model, and governance requirements.
