Governance-first: licensing + provenance gates before publish

The problem
Heading

Most spatial systems are built for databases, not distribution.

Body

Modern teams need spatial context everywhere: web apps, analytics notebooks, field devices, and increasingly autonomous tools. But the typical stack makes it hard to answer simple questions with confidence:

“Which layer version did we use?”

“Can we reproduce last week’s decision?”

“Are we allowed to redistribute this dataset?”

“Why is performance great in the office and painful in the field?”

When spatial context isn’t versioned, governed, and cache-friendly, every app rebuilds the same layers—and every stakeholder loses trust.

What we do
Heading

Spatial Packs are the product. The CDN is the delivery.

Intro

Spatial.Properties treats spatial context as a publishable artifact—not an ad‑hoc set of tables and services.

Three pillars
1) Pack‑first source of record

A Spatial Pack is a versioned bundle of assets plus a manifest that records:

schemas

licensing and attribution

provenance and derived‑from relationships

integrity hashes

deltas between versions

security classification and visibility rules

Result: your “what” and your “why” ship together.

2) Spatial context CDN

We serve packs through an edge‑optimized CDN:

immutable, versioned paths

long TTLs with strong ETags

range requests for large assets

signed URLs for controlled access

Result: predictable performance without rebuilding the world per application.

3) Deterministic workflows for humans and agents

Tools operate on URIs (e.g., pmtiles://, parquet://) and produce publishable layers + manifest patches.

Result: workflows you can reproduce, audit, and operationalize—without “magic” hidden state.

How it works
Heading

From source data to edge delivery—without losing trust.

Ingest
Capture source metadata, license, checksums, and scope.

Normalize & conflate
Bring multiple sources into canonical schemas with lineage.

Build
Generate open, modern assets: GeoParquet (SoR), PMTiles (delivery), COG (raster), COPC (point clouds).

Publish
Create spatialpack.json, compute hashes, register catalog entries, emit events.

Serve & sync
Deliver globally via CDN. Update clients via deltas when it’s efficient; fall back to full refresh when it’s not.

What makes us different
Heading

Hard edges. Clear non‑goals.

We’re not a WMS/WFS re-host.
We publish packs as versioned artifacts designed for modern consumption.

We don’t treat PostGIS as the system of record.
Databases are scratch/caching. Packs are the authoritative unit.

We ship governance as a feature, not a policy doc.
License compatibility and provenance validation are enforced before a pack is published.

We’re built for real distribution.
Edge caching, immutable paths, integrity verification, and signed access are default—not add‑ons.

Solutions (use cases)
Heading

Built for teams who operate in the real world.

Utilities & resources

Operational layers that teams can trust: assets, access constraints, vegetation or risk overlays, and field-ready basemaps.

Government & public agencies

Publish authoritative datasets with clear provenance, licensing constraints, and consistent multi-tenant access.

Incident & outage response

Make “current context” available fast—plus offline-capable packs when connectivity is degraded.

Apps, analytics, and autonomous tools

Deliver deterministic spatial context to apps and agents that need to explain what they used—and why.

Trust: performance, reliability, security
Heading

Designed for reliability—measured with SLOs.

Operational targets include:

p95 first visual tile < 2 seconds

p95 tile hit < 500 ms

p95 STAC search < 600 ms

99.9% availability target

DR targets: RPO ≤ 15 min, RTO ≤ 60 min

Security summary (plain language)

OIDC for humans, mTLS identity for devices/agents

Signed URLs with tenant and scope claims

Per-tenant encryption keys and least-privilege access controls

Layer-level classification and visibility rules

Core concept: Spatial Packs
Heading

What is a Spatial Pack?

A Spatial Pack is a versioned bundle of spatial assets (vector, raster, point cloud) plus a manifest (spatialpack.json) that describes the pack’s identity, scope, layers, schemas, licensing, provenance, integrity, and update strategy.

Spatial Packs are designed to be:

Immutable by version (new versions publish to new paths)

Auditable (license + provenance travel with the data)

Cache-friendly (delivery assets optimized for the edge)

Reproducible (tools operate on URIs and emit manifest patches)

Callout

If you can name it, version it, and verify it—you can operationalize it.

Data formats (why these)
Heading

Open formats that work in production.

We use modern formats because they make distribution and analysis predictable:

GeoParquet — source of record for vector analytics

PMTiles — fast, portable tile delivery

COG (Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF) — raster streaming and pyramids

COPC (Cloud Optimized Point Cloud) — point clouds that can be served efficiently

STAC — cataloging for discovery and search

Versioning and deltas
Heading

Versioning you can trust. Deltas when it makes sense.

Every pack version is published under an immutable version path. That means:

no silent overwrites

easy rollbacks

deterministic “what did we ship?”

When updates are small, we publish deltas so clients can pull minimal bytes. When deltas get too large, clients can fall back to a full refresh. Integrity hashes allow clients to verify assets before committing an update.

spatial context CDN
Heading

Fast delivery, globally—without fragile bespoke map stacks.

Spatial.Properties serves pack assets through an edge CDN designed for real consumption:

long TTL caching with strong ETags

range requests for large assets

signed URLs for controlled access

cache invalidation driven by publishing new versions (not mutating old ones)

Result: applications spend less time “being a GIS,” and more time delivering user value.

Search and discovery
Heading

Find the right pack fast.

Packs register into a STAC-backed catalog so teams can search by:

bbox / region

time range

schema

license

tenant

You can power “browse and load” experiences, internal catalogs, or agent planning workflows—without custom glue.

Governance that ships with the product
Heading

Licensing and provenance are enforced—not “best effort.”

Spatial.Properties includes a license & provenance service that:

validates license compatibility before publishing

maintains derived‑from relationships and source versions

exposes lineage for buyers and reviewers

supports marketplace policy lenses (what can be publicly listed vs. tenant-only)

Plain-language promise

If a pack can’t be legally or operationally trusted, it doesn’t publish.

Tools: deterministic operations (MCP)
Heading

Tools that produce publishable results.

Spatial.Properties supports deterministic tool execution (MCP-style orchestration) where tools:

accept URIs (not hidden database state)

run explicit operations (buffer, overlay, clip, select, raster slope/hillshade, routing, etc.)

produce new layers and a manifest patch so results can be versioned and reused

This is how you move from “analysis in someone’s laptop” to “repeatable operational capability.”

CSP-1 for agent-ready context
Heading

CSP‑1: context packets for agents and edge clients.

CSP‑1 is a profile layered over Spatial Packs that lets clients fetch only what they need for their near-future operating area—using H3/S2 scope, required layers, policy overlays, and live layer topics.

It’s designed for:

route-based prefetch

offline-first caches

delta apply on-device

integrity verification under constrained networks

What you can build with Spatial.Properties
Heading

From web maps to field ops to autonomous workflows.

Multi-source basemaps and operational layers with clean versioning

“Load from manifest” viewers and internal portals

Offline bundles for field work

Governance-first public data products

Agent systems that can cite exactly what spatial context they used

The shift
Heading

Why now

Two things are happening at once:

Spatial data is moving from specialist GIS teams into every workflow—operations, risk, planning, and field execution.

New consumers (apps and agents) require fast, scoped, reproducible context, not bespoke map servers and manual provenance audits.

When context is not versioned, governed, and easy to distribute, trust breaks—especially in regulated and high-stakes environments.

What we’re building
Heading

A product layer for spatial context

Spatial.Properties defines a new primitive: the Spatial Pack.

It’s versioned and immutable by design

It carries licensing, provenance, integrity, and deltas

It’s delivered globally via CDN

It supports deterministic tooling and agent-ready context packets (CSP‑1)

This is “software product thinking” applied to geospatial data.

Initial wedge and expansion
Heading

Go-to-market focus

Initial wedge: Western Australian utilities and resources
Next: state/local government and operational platforms

These buyers share the same requirements:

strong governance and provenance

predictable performance in the field

repeatable workflows (not bespoke consulting forever)

controlled redistribution and clear licensing boundaries

Defensibility
Heading

Why this is hard to copy

Pack-first source of record
Most platforms treat delivery as a thin layer on top of databases. Packs invert that model.

Governance gates integrated into publishing
License compatibility and provenance validation are pre-publish hard requirements—not a downstream policy exercise.

CDN-native delivery with immutability
Versioned, immutable asset paths and integrity verification support reproducibility and large-scale distribution.

CSP‑1 for the agent era
Scoped context packets (H3/S2), policy overlays, and live layer topics create a clean interface for edge and autonomous systems.

Business model (high-level, concrete)
Heading

How we make money

Platform subscription per tenant (control plane, governance, catalog)

Usage-based delivery (CDN egress, API volume, tool execution)

Marketplace revenue share for third-party published packs (optional, phased)

The platform is designed so value scales with adoption while keeping operational costs visible and controllable.

Cost transparency (investor-friendly)
Heading

Operating cost scales predictably

Example AWS-based monthly estimates (Sydney region, Oct 2025 assumptions):

MVP dev/staging: ~$680/month

Production (10TB): ~$5,862/month

Production (100TB): ~$22,770/month

Production (1PB): ~$101,775/month

We treat cost and cache efficiency as product constraints (e.g., cache hit rate targets, delta thresholds, and budget alarms).

What “success” looks like
Heading

Viewer loads by manifest

Core tools (buffer/overlay)

Primary CTA: Read the docs
Secondary CTA: Get API access

Core idea (developer framing)
Heading

Everything is a URI. Everything is versioned.

Instead of coupling your app to a database schema and a map server configuration, you work with:

pack IDs

manifest URLs

layer URIs (pmtiles://, parquet://, cog://)

immutable versions and optional deltas

That makes your app reproducible by default.

Quickstart
Heading

Quickstart: load a pack and render a map

Step 1 — Get the pack manifest
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  https://api.spatial.properties/v1/packs/spatial.properties:wa:transport:v12


You’ll receive (or be redirected to) a spatialpack.json with layer endpoints and metadata.

Step 2 — Render PMTiles in MapLibre
import maplibregl from "maplibre-gl";
// Use your preferred PMTiles integration for MapLibre.
// The manifest provides a TileJSON URL and/or PMTiles URL per layer.

const map = new maplibregl.Map({
  container: "map",
  style: "https://cdn.spatial.properties/styles/base.json",
  center: [115.86, -31.95],
  zoom: 10
});

Step 3 — Query GeoParquet (when permitted)

If your tenant policy allows analytics on the client, the manifest exposes Parquet URIs. You can query with DuckDB (server-side or DuckDB-WASM client-side) for fast ad-hoc analysis without standing up bespoke services.

APIs (what exists, plainly)
Heading

Core APIs

Pack service (build, publish, search)
POST /v1/packs                 # start a build
GET  /v1/packs/{packId}        # pack details
POST /v1/packs/{packId}        # publish pack
POST /v1/packs/{packId}/delta  # create delta
POST /v1/packs/search          # catalog search

Marketplace (optional, phased)
POST /v1/marketplace/publishers
POST /v1/marketplace/listings
GET  /v1/marketplace/listings?bbox=&schema=&license=
POST /v1/marketplace/listings/{id}/delist
GET  /v1/marketplace/reports/{publisherId}/revenue

Edge sync (for constrained/offline clients)
POST /v1/edge/peers/register
POST /v1/edge/exchanges
POST /v1/edge/beacons
GET  /v1/edge/hints?packId=&h3=

Deterministic tools (MCP)
Heading

Run tools that publish results back into packs

Tools accept URIs and produce:

a new published layer (e.g., PMTiles)

a manifest patch referencing the new layer

Example tool request (buffer):

{
  "tool": "buffer",
  "input": {
    "layer_uri": "pmtiles://cdn.spatial.properties/packs/v12/roads.pmtiles",
    "distance": { "value": 100, "units": "m" },
    "dissolve": false
  },
  "output": {
    "format": "pmtiles",
    "publish": true,
    "layer_name": "roads_buffer"
  }
}

Why this matters

Your pipeline becomes:

explainable (inputs are explicit)

repeatable (versions are immutable)

operational (outputs publish into the same product system)

CSP‑1 (agents and edge clients)
Heading

CSP‑1: fetch only the context you need

CSP‑1 is a profile on top of spatialpack.json that adds:

H3/S2 scoped packet definitions

required layers

policy overlays

live layer topics

client hints for prefetch and delta application

This is how you support:

route-based prefetch

offline-first caches

integrity verification

“show your work” for agent decisions

Authentication & security (developer summary)
Heading

Security model

Humans: OIDC (Auth0/Okta/Cognito-compatible)

Agents/devices: mTLS identity + device certificates

Assets: signed URLs with tenant/scope claims (and optional anti-replay nonce)

Authorization: ABAC/RBAC with classification and visibility rules at layer/overlay granularity

Encryption: at-rest per-tenant keys; in-transit TLS

Performance notes (useful, not fluffy)
Heading

Performance, by design

Use immutable version paths for strong caching

Prefer deltas for frequent small updates

Fall back to full refresh when deltas exceed thresholds

Verify integrity hashes before committing cached assets

Target high cache hit rates to keep latency stable at p95
