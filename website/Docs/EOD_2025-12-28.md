# EOD Summary: 2025-12-28

## Session Overview

Continued development of the Spatial.Properties marketing website after a period away from the project. Primary focus was on resuming work and understanding the current state.

## Current Project State

### What's Built

The website scaffolding is complete with:

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js 14 (App Router, static export)
- TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v3
- Custom design tokens (Instrument Serif headings, Inter body, coordinate grid texture)

**Completed Pages/Components:**
1. **Homepage** (`src/app/page.tsx`) - 9 sections following buyer journey:
   - Hero - outcome-led positioning for greenfield development
   - Problem - why site decisions break without trust
   - WhatItIs - subscription catalog model explained
   - PackCatalog - 4 WA-specific packs (Data Centre, Transmission, Approvals, Basemap)
   - WhatsInAPack - layers + defensibility
   - HowItWorks - humanized pipeline
   - Differentiators - hard edges, clear non-goals
   - Trust - SLO metrics table
   - ClosingCTA - book a pilot

2. **Contact Page** (`src/app/contact/page.tsx`) - Calendly embed + email contacts

3. **Layout Components:**
   - Header with navigation
   - Footer
   - Section wrapper with background variants

4. **UI Primitives:**
   - Button (primary/secondary/ghost variants)
   - Card
   - Badge

5. **Placeholder Pages:**
   - Demo (video walkthrough placeholder)
   - Product
   - Solutions
   - Developers
   - Investors
   - Pricing

### Known Issue: Build Cache Lock

The `.next` folder has a locked `trace` file preventing clean rebuilds.

**Resolution:** Manually delete the `.next` folder before running `npm run build`.

## Business Model Context

**Critical clarification from previous session:**
- Spatial.Properties is NOT primarily infrastructure to publish your own packs
- It IS a subscription catalog of curated packs for greenfield development
- Target: WA data centres, transmission corridors, major projects
- Positioning: outcomes first (site decisions faster), technical details below fold
