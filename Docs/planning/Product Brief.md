# **Spatial.Properties – Product Brief**

### **Tagline**

**The world, pre-compiled.**
Spatial.Properties delivers AI-ready geospatial context—packaged, standardized, and streamed through a global CDN for real-time decisions.

---

### **1. The Problem**

Traditional GIS pipelines are slow, siloed, and built for human analysts—not for autonomous systems or AI workflows.

* **Manual, platform-locked workflows** create latency between insight and action.
* **Data fragmentation** across maps, sensors, and databases blocks interoperability.
* **AI agents, drones, and field systems** need lightweight, cacheable spatial context—not full enterprise GIS stacks.

---

### **2. The Solution**

**Spatial.Properties** transforms complex spatial data into modular **Spatial Packs**—AI-ready bundles that can be streamed, cached, or embedded at the edge.

| Component                | Description                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spatial Packs**        | Pre-packaged GeoParquet, PMTiles, and COG/COPC datasets, enriched with semantics, metadata, and provenance.            |
| **Spatial Context CDN**  | Global edge delivery network enabling low-latency access and offline caching for AI agents, apps, and devices.         |
| **API & SDKs**           | Modern APIs and lightweight client libraries for integration into AI workflows, digital twins, and enterprise systems. |
| **Curated Data Library** | Continuously maintained datasets across maps, terrain, infrastructure, environment, and operational layers.            |

### **3. How It Works**

1. **Ingest & Curate** – Open or enterprise spatial data is standardized and enriched into AI-ready formats.
2. **Pack & Version** – Data is modularized into Spatial Packs, each representing a geohash-tile of the world with multi-layer context.
3. **Distribute & Cache** – Packs are served via a CDN, allowing devices or apps to fetch just the context they need—fast, offline-capable, and cacheable.
4. **Integrate & Automate** – APIs feed Spatial Packs directly into analytics, LLMs, and autonomous systems for place-aware decisioning.

### **4. Core Value Propositions**

* **AI-ready context:** Enables LLMs and agents to understand “place” without manual GIS steps.
* **Edge-first design:** Works offline or in low-connectivity environments.
* **Open by default:** Built on open standards (STAC, GeoParquet, PMTiles, COG).
* **Semantic enrichment:** Metadata and ontology alignment for meaningful machine interpretation.
* **Scalable & interoperable:** Integrates with modern data lakes, cloud-native stacks, and AI frameworks.

---

### **5. Use Cases**

* **Autonomous field operations:** Utilities, mining, and logistics systems fetching spatial packs for on-site awareness.
* **AI assistants & LLMs:** Access local rules, hazards, and features to answer “where” questions with context.
* **Digital twins:** Stream real-time geospatial updates without reprocessing layers.
* **Compliance & risk:** Deliver authoritative spatial intelligence to meet safety, environmental, and operational standards.

### **6. Market Position**

Spatial.Properties sits between **data infrastructure** and **AI enablement**, bridging the gap between traditional GIS and real-time spatial intelligence for autonomous systems.
It complements cloud data lakes, modern analytics, and generative AI tools—enabling organizations to move from **maps to machine-ready context.**
