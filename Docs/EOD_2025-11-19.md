# End of Day Summary — 2025-11-19

## Session Overview
Initial context loading and project orientation session. No code was written; this was a discovery/planning session.

## Project Understanding

### What is Spatial.Properties?
An AI-ready spatial data delivery platform serving geospatial context as **Spatial Packs** — versioned, immutable bundles (GeoParquet, PMTiles, COG, COPC) delivered via CDN/API. Designed for LLMs and AI agents needing spatial context without traditional GIS service overhead.

### Core Principles
- **Pack-first**: Pre-built, byte-rangeable, cacheable bundles
- **Spec-driven**: Features implemented only from merged specs
- **Edge delivery**: Cacheable, range-requestable, resumable
- **Open semantics**: STAC/GeoArrow standards

### Current State
- **No implementation code exists** — specification phase only
- Repository contains:
  - Specs: `spec/constitution.md`, `spec/features/0001-spatial-pack-registry.md`
  - ADR: `adr/0001-pack-first-architecture.md`
  - Planning docs in `Docs/`
  - Specify workflow templates in `.specify/`

## First Feature: Spatial Pack Registry (MVP)

### API Surface (v0)
```
GET /v0/packs?bbox=&topic=&limit=  → list manifests
GET /v0/packs/{pack_id}            → manifest detail
GET /v0/packs/{pack_id}/artifacts/{name} → 302 to pre-signed URL
GET /v0/health                     → {"status":"ok"}
```

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 within 50ms
- [ ] List API returns manifests filtered by bbox/topic
- [ ] Detail API returns full manifest with artifacts
- [ ] Artifact endpoint redirects (302) to signed URL
- [ ] OpenAPI doc generated
- [ ] Dockerized service runs locally

### Performance Targets
- p95 `GET /v0/packs` < 120ms (local)
- p95 TTFB from artifact pre-signed URL < 200ms (local/MinIO)

## Next Session: Recommended Actions

### Option 1: Walking Skeleton (Recommended)
1. **Initialize project structure**
   - Choose stack: NestJS (TypeScript) or Go
   - Set up project with linting, testing
   - Add Dockerfile

2. **Implement endpoints with mock data**
   - `/v0/health` → `{"status":"ok"}`
   - `/v0/packs` → hardcoded manifest list
   - `/v0/packs/{id}` → manifest detail
   - `/v0/packs/{id}/artifacts/{name}` → mock redirect

3. **Add supporting infrastructure**
   - Docker Compose with service + MinIO placeholder
   - OpenAPI generation from code
   - Basic test suite

4. **Seed demo data**
   - "WA demo roads" pack manifest

### Option 2: Use Specify Workflow
Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate actionable tasks from the existing spec before coding.

## Key Files to Reference
- `spec/features/0001-spatial-pack-registry.md` — Feature spec with API contracts
- `spec/constitution.md` — Non-negotiables and working agreements
- `adr/0001-pack-first-architecture.md` — Architecture decision
- `Docs/planning/04-Implementation-Plan.md` — Full implementation roadmap

## Open Questions (from spec)
- H3 vs S2 for spatial index? (prototype supports either)
- Sign manifests? (likely JSON Web Signature; to be decided in ADR)

## Git Status
- Branch: `master`
- Remote: `https://github.com/Future-Bridge-AI/spatial.properties.git`
- Status: Clean, pushed to origin
- Last commit: `0092115 docs: add EOD summary for 2025-11-19 session`

## Session Artifacts
- This EOD document created and pushed to GitHub
