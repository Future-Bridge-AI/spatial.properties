# Spatial.Properties — Spec-Driven Repo

This repo is the source of truth for decisions and scope:
- `spec/constitution.md` — non-negotiables and operating rules
- `spec/features/` — implementable, testable feature specs
- `adr/` — Architecture Decision Records

⚑ Working principle: shipping beats perfect. Every change starts as a spec PR.
